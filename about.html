		      <h1> Unicorn Game</h1>
			  <h3> Storyline </h3>
			  <p> My video game is about a Unicorn named Sparkles. Sparkles lives in the pink sparkly clouds and really loves ice cream.
	             Unfortunately the ice cream shop is a looong way away from her house and her enemy, a mean unicorn has placed traps and found ways to inconvenience her from getting her ice cream. </p>
			
			  <h3> How to play </h3>
              <p> You win if the unicorn (you) gets across from her house to the ice cream shops and eats her ice cream. You lose if you fail to take yourself across the parkour. For example if you touch one of the traps it will trap you and teleport you back to your house. The player controls are up (jump) left (walk left) right (walk right) keys on your keyboard. As you progress the sky gets darker and darker and there is a very pretty sunset. At the end of the game you're in your house eating your ice cream with the starry night around you. </p>
